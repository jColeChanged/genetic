# genetic

A while back Roger Alsing [wrote a program which evolved the mona lisa](http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/). I decided to write a similar program which accomplishes the same sort of goal: evolving an image. I use a different approach, but the biggest difference between my program and Roger's is that I provide a GUI.

## Usage

I'll be putting up a jar file when I finish the project. If you want to check out the GUI it is in genetic.core. If you want to check out the code I'm using to evolve the image you can find that in genetic.genetic.
